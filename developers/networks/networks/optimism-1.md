# Avalanche

To use Superfluid with Avalanche, you'll need a RPC URL to connect your Metamask or application to an Avalanche node.

> If you want to learn more about Avalanche, the full documentation is here: [https://docs.avax.network/](https://docs.avax.network/)

To add Avalanche to Metamask, you can head to your Settings in Metamask, and select Networks. Click 'Add Network,' and enter an Avalanche RPC URL such as [https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc](https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc)
