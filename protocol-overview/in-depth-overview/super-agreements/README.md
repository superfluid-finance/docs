# Super Agreements

## Definition

Super Agreements are the additional value transfer functionality that Super Tokens have. When an account engages in a Super Agreement with another account, it agrees to have its Super Token balance modified according to the rules of the agreement and chosen parameters. Currently, there are two available Super Agreements: the **Constant Flow Agreement** and the **Instant Distribution Agreement**.&#x20;
