# 🌊 Superfluid Wave Pool

![Surf's up](../.gitbook/assets/waves-illustration.png)

### What's the Wave Pool?

The Wave Pool is a "continuous hackathon" that repeats every month. During the month, community members may submit Superfluid-related work to each Wave and be put in the running for the Wave's prizes (like a hackathon!).

However, unlike a hackathon, the Wave Pool is **not just for technical work**! __ Non-technical work such as articles, videos, documentation, and tutorials are all considered and encouraged for submission.

&#x20;The Wave Pool is somewhat like a fill-in-the-blank bounty program that aims to reward the wide variety of work that Superfluid community members complete without us explicitly targeting those work items with bounties. Let's reward and recognize good work when we see it!

**Each Wave is numbered** - The first Wave starting on September 1st, 2022 is Wave #1, the one for October will be Wave #2 and so on.

**Waves last over each month** - For example, Wave #1 will span from September 1st to September 30th. Right after one finishes, the next one starts!

**Start or Submit **_**ANYTIME**_** ** - Wave Projects can be started or submitted at _any time_. The only limitation is that your submission must be completed during the Wave you submit it for. So for example, work you finished 3 months ago wouldn't be eligible for this month's Wave.

### Current Prizes

Currently, the top three submissions to the current Wave will earn one of the below prizes 🥇

**1st Place** - $1,000

**2nd Place** - $750

**3rd Place** - $500

If you did good work, but didn’t quite make the Top 3 cut, we may likely reward you an ad hoc **Honorable Mention** prize!

### Get Started 🙋‍♀️

#### **1. First, understand what kind of work is acceptable 👇**

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:green;"><strong>Guidelines for Acceptable Work</strong></mark></summary>

**1. Pertains to Superfluid, doesn't just use Superfluid as a side element**

**2. Open source and/or shareable**

**3. Completed during the Wave**

Say you complete an article during Wave #1 in September but want to submit it to Wave #2 in October - that work won't be accepted.

**4. In a state of “itemized completion”**

Your submission should be a consolidated deliverable/feature that can work as intended and can be demonstrated.

**5. Good quality**

“Good quality” is rather subjective. We know it when we see it and we will develop precedence with each Wave. As we approach the submission deadline, if there are not enough quality submissions, we would rather not reward a prize than to issue one a scrappy submission.

**6. Presentable**

An article or video is already presentable, but if you're submitting code, make sure it's documented (with a README or something) or submit it with a video explainer!

**7. New Work**

Previous hackathon Superfluid submissions won't count unless you're submitting additional post-hackathon itemized progress.

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Examples of Acceptable and Unacceptable Work</mark></summary>

**Acceptable Examples**

* Integrating Superfluid with an existing protocol ([Instadapp integration example](https://github.com/Instadapp/dsa-connectors/pull/244))
* A completed and published article on Superfluid concepts ([Donoso example](https://medium.com/@javier\_donoso/superfluid-gelato-for-stream-scheduling-7c32ed975f04))
* A completed and well documented example showing Superfluid integrated with Lens Protocol ([Wary Lens PR example](https://github.com/aave/lens-protocol/pull/101))
* A detailed and completed written specification showing how to create tradeable tokenized salaries ([NIFLOT example](https://www.notion.so/2db13f22833149ffa7d03e0f1de71af6))
* Improvement to one of our Docs pages or sections (propose your fixes, inquire for a Editor invite link in the bounties channel, and we’ll set you up!)
* A video explainer on Superfluid or Superfluid dev concepts ([Fugu example](https://youtu.be/L2364bmZA5o))
* A new completed stream management UI feature for a Superfluid-powered project ([Ricochet example](https://github.com/Ricochet-Exchange/ricochet-frontend/issues/97))

**Unacceptable Example**

* A completed project that only discusses how it will use Superfluid and does not implement anything
* A partially completed article
* An itemized completion that does not pertain to Superfluid but is for a Superfluid-related project
  * Ex: You make a CI/CD pipeline for your Superfluid-powered lending protocol
* A project that does not achieve its stated purpose (Ex: I say I will make a tradeable NFT cashflow project, but my contract does not succeed in editing the flow upon transfer of the NFT)

{% hint style="info" %}
If after reading this, you're unsure if your work is acceptable - ask us in our Discord or **just go for it**! There's nothing to lose and we can always be flexible.
{% endhint %}

#### **2. Come up with an idea**&#x20;

Here is an assortment of different ideas for things to tackle as your Wave Project:

{% embed url="https://superfluidhq.notion.site/Superfluid-Wave-Pool-Ideas-7e8c792758004bd2ae452d1f9810cc58" %}

We suggest you drop your idea in the [#🌊wave-pool](https://discord.com/channels/752490247643725875/1017102296372478052) channel in our Discord so we can give some thoughts and feedback. We could also open a thread for support as you begin navigating your work!

#### **3. Start working on it**

{% hint style="info" %}
If you _finished_ the work several months ago, then you can't wait and submit it to the current Wave. It's old work! We want to see newly completed work ✨\
\
When you _start_ the work doesn't matter. You could have been working on something for several months and it will still be eligible for submission to the current Wave as long as you've newly completed it.
{% endhint %}

#### **4. Submit your work before month end**

Submit your Wave Project to the Wave Pool Submission Form 👇

If you worked together on a team on your Wave Project, just submit once for the whole team

**5. Winners are announced**&#x20;

If you have a winning submission, the day after the Wave completes, we will DM you with details on on how to claim your prize along with a POAP to commemorate your accomplishment!&#x20;
